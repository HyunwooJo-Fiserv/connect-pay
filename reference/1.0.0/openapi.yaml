    ### Fiserv PayByBank solution exposes a set of services to facilitate ACH account vaulting, authorization and settlement. 
    PayByBank follows an enroll first and pay later model. Consumer needs to first enroll himself into the system by providing demographic and ACH payment information. The payment information is tokenized and ACH transactions can be sent in by merchants using the PayByBank token.
    Authorization, Risking, Settlement are all inhouse functionalities to TeleCheck.

    PayByBank solution enforces a full payload encryption. Details of encryption and decryption can be found at [Encryption/Decryption Methodology](https://escmconfluence.1dc.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=498239026).

        In either of the api calls, merchant have the option to retrieve the banking information in clear/masked. A merchant specific setting enables a merchant to retrieve the banking information either in clear or in mask as per business.
